        <p class="blog-paragraph">I learned python during my final year of M.Tech and the journey has been amazing so far. The idea to learn python came to me when I started applying for jobs. While applying, I gradually realized that I had to stand out from the crowd, so I learned python since it is the easiest programming language to learn.</p>
        
        <p class="blog-paragraph">2 years down the line, on the month of August this year I met JavaScript and its friends (HTML & CSS). I knew I had to graduate from the python class and since I fell in love with staring at 2 monitors while developing python selenium scripts, web development seemed like the perfect next chapter in my journey book. I feel that, had I known java or C++ earlier, JavaScript would have come easier to me but whatever. The journey has been both rocky and pleasant and I plan to continue this journey.</p>

        <ul class="topic-list">
            <li class="topics">
                <h2><span class="highlight-word">Anonymous</span> functions</h2>
                <p class="blog-paragraph">What are these???? I had a really hard time understanding how anonymous function works. This is really a foreign concept to me because for python, a function will always have a name but for anonymous functions, you don’t need to define a name, hence the name anonymous.</p>

                <img class = "blog-topic-img"  src="/images/anno.jpg" alt="">

                
                <p class="blog-paragraph">A practical use case for anonymous functions will be using it as a <span><a href="/" id = "blog-words-link">CALLBACK</a></span> function for the <span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" id = "blog-words-link" target="_blank">addEventListener</a></span> method:</p>

                <img class = "blog-topic-img"  src="/images/anon_event_listener.jpg" alt="">

                <p class="blog-paragraph">A good example of what this function does and how it works can be found <span><a href="https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-anonymous-functions/" id = "blog-words-link" target="_blank">HERE</a></span></p>

            </li>


            <li class="topics">
                <h2><span class="highlight-word">Arrow</span> functions and <span class="highlight-word">Regular</span> functions:</h2>

                <p class="blog-paragraph">Well well well, what do we have here……2 types of methods to do the same thing? Of course! Jokes aside though, you can actually write a function in 2 ways. If you’re looking for alternative and compact way to write your code, Arrow functions is the way to go!</p>

                <img class = "blog-topic-img"  src="/images/arrow_func.jpg" alt="">

                <p class="blog-paragraph">In the code above, you can see our funtion named as <strong>lolAddFunc</strong> which takes in 2 variables <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>and shows them up in the console on the right side but we dont see the word <strong>"function"</strong> being used to define the function. Instead of that we see a <strong>"=>"</strong> which signifies its an arrow function.
                </p> 

                <p class="blog-paragraph">Here is another example comparing arrow functions to normal functions.</p> 
                <img class = "blog-topic-img"  src="/images/arrow_func2.jpg" alt="">



                <p class="blog-paragraph">A good example of what this function does and how it works can be found <span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions/" id = "blog-words-link" target="_blank">HERE</a></span></p>

            </li>


            <li class="topics">
                    <h2><span class="highlight-word">Callback</span> functions:</h2>
    
                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Soooooo many type of functions, I know! Callback functions put simply, are functions which are passed as parameters to another functions.</p>
                    
                    <p class="blog-paragraph">We came across this during the <span><a href="https://neog.camp/guide/lesson-four/" id = "blog-words-link" target="_blank">4th lecture</a></span> of NeoG Camp Level 0. I did read up on this type of functions and came to know that there is a thing called  <span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Concepts/" id = "blog-words-link" target="_blank">asynchronous programming</a>. What it means is that, suppose there is a line of code (we will keep it at line no. 16) and it is flanked by two other lines which are line 15 and 17. Now, upon execution, it is not necessary for line no 16 to execute after the code from line 15 has executed. The code from line 16 will run after some event is triggered or something happens.</p>

                    <img class = "blog-topic-img"  src="/images/callback_func.jpg" alt="">
                    
                    <p class="blog-paragraph">In the image displayed above, we can observe that inside the <strong>addEventListener</strong> method, after "click", we have <strong>dataFetch</strong> which is actually a function which is defined above but it is without a parenthesis which makes it a callback function!</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">So, to call a callback function, we don’t use parenthesis. Just the function name would do. A good example of what this function does and how it works can be found <span><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-callback-functions-what-are-callbacks-in-js-and-how-to-use-them/" id = "blog-words-link" target="_blank">HERE</a></span></p>

                </li>
            
        </ul>

        
        <p class="blog-paragraph">Apart from these topics, these are some of my other observations:
            
            <ol class="misc-points-list">
                <li id = "misc-points">We can access global variables even if they are not passed explicitly to a function.</li>
                <li id = "misc-points"><strong>"=="</strong> evaluates only the variables but not their dataType but <strong>"==="</strong> evaluated both the variables and their dataType.</li>
                <li id = "misc-points">DONOT forget to check for <strong>;</strong> while searching for errors!</li>
            </ol>
            
        </p>




        <p class="blog-paragraph">So these were some of my observations while working with JavaScript. I ma pretty sure that I will find more of these as I move forward. With that being said, I wish you have a great day/night ahead. See ya!
