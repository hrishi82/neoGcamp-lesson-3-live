        <p class="blog-paragraph"><strong>Magnetorheological Elastomers (MRE)</strong> are a type of smart materials
            which change their flow and deformation properties when they come in the vicinity of a magnetic field. These
            consist of ferromagnetic particles spread in the matrix of an elastomer like silicon rubber, natural rubber
            and so on.</p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">The damping property of the MRE is due to the presence of a rubber matrix which
            promotes viscous flow and also due to the magnetic particles embedded into the rubber matrix. MR elastomers
            is an analogous to magnetorheological fluids (MRF) but unlike MR fluids, MR elastomers does not exhibit
            sedimentation of the suspended particles, they work in the pre yield region, contrary to MR fluids which
            work in the post-yield region and also, MR elastomers do not have to be stored as seen in the case of MR
            fluids.</p>


        <p class="blog-paragraph">For the curing of the MR elastomers, two methods are generally used which are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Room temperature vulcanizing</li>
            <li>High temperature vulcanizing</li>
        </ul>


        <p class="blog-paragraph">When dealing with MREs, they are of two types based on how they are cured. They are nased as Anisotropic and Isotropic MREs.</p>

                <p class="blog-paragraph">When curing, if simultaneously a magnetic field is applied during the process
                    to the rubber matrix, then the resulting elastomer is called an <strong>Anisotropic MREâ€™s</strong> where upon
                    application of a magnetic field, the ferromagnetic particles line themselves up in the magnetic
                    field direction forming chain like structure in the process. </p>

                <p class="blog-paragraph">If the mixture is cured without the presence of a magnetic field, the
                    resulting elastomer is called an <strong>Isotropic MRE</strong> where the ferromagnetic particles are distributed
                    inside the matrix with no particular order.</p>

                    <p class="blog-paragraph">Soft-magnetic particles without magnetic hysteresis are the preferred choice of
                            magnetic particles which are embedded into the MR elastomers. These include <strong>carbonyl iron, iron oxides,
                                    nickel, CoFe2O4, FeCo3, Fe3O4</strong>  among others. </p>
    
                    <p class="blog-paragraph">The various matrices employed in the development of MR
                            elastomers include <strong>natural rubber, silicone rubber, polybutadiene, polyisobutylene, polyisoprene and
                                    polyurethene</strong> rubber. It was observed that for the fabrications of MR elastomers, <strong>silicone</strong> is generally used
                            because soft matrix rubbers such as silicone are found to exhibit a higher relative MR effect.</p>
