        <p class="blog-paragraph">Magnetorheological Elastomers (MRE) are a type of smart materials which change their flow and deformation properties when they come in the vicinity of a magnetic field. These consist of ferromagnetic particles spread in the matrix of an elastomer like silicon rubber, natural rubber and so on. The damping property of the MRE is due to the presence of a rubber matrix which promotes viscous flow and also due to the magnetic particles embedded into the rubber matrix. MR elastomers is an analogous to magnetorheological fluids (MRF) but unlike MR fluids, MR elastomers does not exhibit sedimentation of the suspended particles, they work in the pre yield region, contrary to MR fluids which work in the post-yield region and also, MR elastomers do not have to be stored as seen in the case of MR fluids.</p>

        For the curing of the MR elastomers, two methods are generally used which are (a) Room temperature vulcanizing and (b) High temperature vulcanizing. When curing, if simultaneously a magnetic field is applied during the process to the rubber matrix, then the resulting elastomer is called an anisotropic MRE’s where upon application of a magnetic field, the ferromagnetic particles line themselves up in the magnetic field direction forming chain like structure in the process. If the mixture is cured without the presence of a magnetic field, the resulting elastomer is called an isotropic MRE where the ferromagnetic particles are distributed inside the matrix with no particular order. Anisotropic MRE’s exhibits a much larger damping and stiffness value when compared to its isotropic counterparts. Two factors which are very essential in the study of the MR elastomers are the storage and loss modulus. The storage modulus is a measure of the elastic response of a material which means it represents the stored energy. While the loss modulus is a measure of viscous response of a material that is, it measures the energy dissipated as heat

        <p class="blog-paragraph">Soft-magnetic particles without magnetic hysteresis are the preferred choice of magnetic particles which are embedded into the MR elastomers. These include carbonyl iron, iron oxides, nickel, CoFe2O4, FeCo3, Fe3O4 among others. The various matrices employed in the development of MR elastomers include natural rubber, silicone rubber, polybutadiene, polyisobutylene, polyisoprene and polyurethene rubber. It was observed that for the fabrications of MR elastomers, silicone is generally used because soft matrix rubbers such as silicone are found to exhibit a higher relative MR effect. </p>
